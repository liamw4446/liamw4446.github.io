    <li>A peacock is the brightly colored, iridescent-plumed male of the peafowl family, known for its spectacular, long tail feathers, or train, featuring prominent eyespots that it fans out to attract a mate. These birds are members of the pheasant family, native to India and Sri Lanka, and are recognized by their distinctive head crests. While the male is known as a peacock, the female is a peahen, which is smaller and has a drab brown and green body lacking the elaborate train. The colorful display is due to the structural properties of the feathers, not pigments, causing the iridescent colors and a shimmering effect</li>

    <li>A red-tailed hawk is a large North American bird of prey (raptor) known for its broad wings, short tail, and a distinct reddish-brown tail on adults. It is a common sight in open fields, near woodlots, and even in urban areas across the continent, where it hunts small mammals, rodents, and reptiles to help control their populations. Red-tailed hawks are easily recognized by their raspy, screaming call, often heard in movies and television shows, and they play an important role in their ecosystems as top predators</li>

    <li>A chicken is a domesticated bird, scientifically known as Gallus gallus domesticus, descended from the wild junglefowl of Asia. They are commonly raised worldwide for their meat, eggs, and feathers. Physically, they are characterized by short wings, a heavy, round body, and featherless legs, though they are poor fliers due to their build. Males are called roosters or cocks, while females are hens. Both sexes have fleshy combs on their heads and wattles on their throats, with roosters typically having more vibrant plumage and more pronounced combs and wattles</li>
