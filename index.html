  <h2>My Community</h2>
  <p>My dream since I was a kid was to become a major bird watcher and this is a website that I can show birds to.</p>

  <h3>My Family</h3>
  <p>Ever since I was a kid I have always wanted a pet chicken and my family didn’t want one. Now I can hear what different birds sound like.</p>

  <h2>Bird Sounds</h2>
  <p>Birds are nature’s musicians. Their songs serve many purposes: attracting mates, marking territory, warning of danger, or simply communicating with one another. Listening to bird calls can be calming and helps us connect with the natural world.</p>
  <p>Some fascinating facts about bird sounds:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Robins sing early in the morning to mark their territory.</li>
    <li>Nightingales are famous for their complex and beautiful songs.</li>
    <li>Crows use loud calls to warn their group of threats.</li>
    <li>Songbirds often learn their tunes from parents and neighbors.</li>
  </ul>
