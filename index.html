  <h2>Bird Sounds</h2>
  <p>Birds are nature’s musicians. Their songs serve many purposes: attracting mates, marking territory, 
  warning of danger, or simply communicating with one another. Listening to bird calls can be calming 
  and helps us connect with the natural world.</p>
  <p>Some fascinating facts about bird sounds:</p>
  <ul style="text-align:left; max-width:600px; margin:auto;">
    <li>Robins sing early in the morning to mark their territory.</li>
    <li>Nightingales are famous for their complex and beautiful songs.</li>
    <li>Crows use loud calls to warn their group of threats.</li>
    <li>Songbirds often learn their tunes from parents and neighbors.</li>
